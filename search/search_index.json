The simplest way to describe the cell membrane is as a phospholipid bilayer. Bilayer means 2 layers, and there are 2 layers of phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane. The term phospholipid refers to the structure of the molecule-it is made up of a phosphate head and 2 lipid tails. The phosphate head is negatively charged (so can be described as polar) which makes it hydrophilic (hydro-refers to water and -philic means loving). The phosphate head wants to be in contact with water so it faces the intracellular in the extracellular fluid. The lipid tails are uncharged (nonpolar) which makes them hydrophobic. This means that they don't want to be near water. They are located in the centre of the bilayer. The chemical and physical characteristics of the bilayer makes it a semipermeable membrane. This means that some things can pass through it easily whereas others cannot. The molecules that can pass freely through the cell membrane are lipophilic (which means water soluble molecules are unable to pass directly-the membrane is impermeable to these molecules). Another name for the cell membrane is the plasma membrane.","title":"1.1. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"1.2.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"What is the endoplasmic reticulum? What is the difference in roles of the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and what makes the rough endoplasmic reticulum rough? The endoplasmic reticulum is located inside the cells. The prefix endo- means inside (endocrine hormones are released inside the body, endovascular procedures are performed inside blood vessels). A reticulum is a network.The photograph of an Australian reticulated pipe and below shows the way its markings form a network across its skin. It's that network of markings that gives it the name \"reticulated\". The endoplasmic reticulum is located inside the cells. It is the largest organelle in the cell. An organelle is a structure inside the cell that performs a specific function (s). The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of protein synthesis and transport, lipid and steroid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and calcium storage. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is made up of sealed sacs with ribosomes on their surface. It's the ribosomes that give the organelle its a rough appearance when it is viewed with a microscope. Ribosomes are the organelles that are responsible for the assembly of proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is mainly involved in manufacturing lipids, a process that doesn\u2019t require ribosomes.","title":"1.2.

If you are having trouble visualising this, think about what happens when oil is added to water. Can you suggest a physiological process where this might be important? A phospholipid molecule has a phosphate head that is attracted to water (hydrophilic) and two lipid tails that are hydrophobic. When phospholipids are added to water they arrange themselves into phospholipid bilayers into 'balls' called micelles, into liposomes Micelles are formed in the small intestine as fats in our diet are digested. They move through the watery intestinal contents and come in contact with the cells lining the intestine. They can then be absorbed into the cells by simple diffusion. Liposomes are carriers for targeted drug delivery. They help to obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake of drugs. Steps involved in liposome action of drug delivery: 1. Adsorption: Adsorption of liposomes to cell membranes causes its contact on the cell membrane. 2. Endocytosis: Adsorption of liposomes on the cell surface membrane followed by engulfment and internalization into the liposomes 3. Fusion : fusion of lipid bilayers of liposomes with the lipoidal cell membrane by lateral diffusion and intermingling of lipids results in direct delivery of liposomal contents in the cytoplasm. 4. Lipid exchange : Due to the similarity of liposomal lipid membrane with cell membrane phospholipids, lipid transfer proteins in the cell membrane easily recognize liposomes and cause lipid exchange. For example, in case of cancer cells; they consume large amounts of fats to fill the requirement of rapid growth, they recognize the liposomes (loaded with anti-cancer drug) as a potential source of nutrition. When they are targeted by liposome, they get absorbed. Once the anti-cancer drugs are released from the liposome into the site, cancer cells are killed by the drug.","title":"1.3.

Channel proteins are pores (or tunnels) that enable ions to diffuse through the cell membrane into or out of the cell. Some channels are open all the time, allowing continuous free movement. Others are gated, meaning that movement through them is controlled. This is important in physiological functions such as the action potential used by nerves to transmit information. In nerves, it is the gated sodium and potassium channels that are most important. Each ion has its own channel through which it passes - there are separate Na and K channels in the membrane. Thse ions can't pass directly through the membrane because of its lipid core.","title":"1.4.

When speaking about cell death, we use the terms (And a few others not mentioned): 1. Necrosis 2. Apoptosis 3. Autophagy (Autophagocytosis) All of which describe different mechanisms of cell death. In contrast, when speaking about tissues, we use a few terms including: 1. Atrophy 2. Hypertrophy 3. Hypotrophy 4. Hyperplasia 5. Hypoplasia '-trophy' refers to specifically the size of the cell (And thus organ) '-plasia' refers to the NUMBER of cells (And also thus the organ) Cell death in more detail Cells normally die in a cyclical manner - there's the saying that every cell in the human body replaces itself within 10 years (though not sure how true this is...). Cell death can be programmed or non-programmed . Programmed cell death is physiological , in that it is a normal process of cell function - the fact that it is programmed means it is desired (i.e. it is homeostatic). Non-programmed cell death occurs as a result of insult or injury to the cell and is not desired - it is also less controlled and can impact cells nearby. The main mechanisms of programmed cell death are: Apoptosis (a.k.a Type 1 cell death) Autophagy (a.ka. Type 2 cell death) Others include Activation-induced cell death, oncosis, mitotic catastrophe, immunogenic cell death, pyroptosis, necroptosis (NOT necrosis) The mechanism of non-programmed cell death is: Necrosis Apoptosis Occurs in eukaryotes as a homeostatic process Cells normally are thought to be kept alive by 'survival factors' (i.e. chemicals in its environment which provide a reason for the cell to be kept alive) - what the exact factors are, we don't need to know. From a histological level, we see blebbing (bits of the cell membrane bubbling off), cell shrinkage (loss of cytoplasm and membrane), nuclear fragmentation and DNA(the DNA within the nucleus falls apart), chromatin condensation - essentially, the cell commits suicide. these small fragments are called 'apoptotic bodies' - these float around and are taken up by phagocytes Examples of apoptosis Separation of fingers and toes in the embryo More detail into apoptosis Cells experience stress (intrinsic) or get signals from other cells (extrinsic) to kil themselves -> caspases (a specific protease - an enzyme which breaks down proteins) are activated -> activates more caspases -> destroys proteins within the cell -> destroys the cellular structure -> the cell dies Things that activate the intrinsic pathway: stress hormones (cortisol), head, radiation, viruses, high intracellular Ca2+ The mitochondria as it releases cytochrome c , which activates caspase cascade. Autophagy 'Auto' - self , '-phagy' - eat ; Autophagy is the process of the cell eating itself Pathophysiology The cell forms large vacuoles (pockets within the cytoplasm) which eat the organelles up before it eats the nucleus Macroautophagy - autophagosome/lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic contents, protein aggregates, damaged organelles What activates autophagy Nutrient deprivation Stress, infection, cancer, neurodegeneration, etc. Necrosis Pathophysiology Trauma, infection -> cell damage -> cell membrane erupts (i.e. the cell literally explodes) -> nearby cells are infalmmed If you're interested in understanding these cell mechanisms more, I would recommend starting with the wikipedia article here - if you want to learn more, ask me questions during the ask weber sessions.","title":"Apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis"},{"location":"Mistakes/Cell%20death/#apoptosis-necrosis-necroptosis","text":"","title":"Apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis"},{"location":"Mistakes/Cell%20death/#question","text":"I was asked about different forms of cell death","title":"Question"},{"location":"Mistakes/Cell%20death/#putting-into-perspective","text":"Some words are used to describe death of tissues , and some words are used to describe death of cells .

Expanded answer Osmolarity is a measure of concentration of osmotically active particles in solution - depends on number of particles in a volume of solution (Rather than what the type of particle is) Osmolarity differs from molarity as individual ions contribute to the osmolarity For example: - 1Mol of NaCl in 1 L of water has a molarity of 1mol/L - However in water, $NaCl(aq) \\rightarrow Na^{+}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)$ - This means that the osmolality of this solution is 2 Osmol/L (as NaCl dissociates into 2 ions) - 1 mol of glucose in 1L of water has a molarity of 1mol/L - In water, glucose doesn't deionise, meaning its osmolality is still 1 Osmol/L To define tonicity, you need 2 compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane e.g. a cell in solution Questions (from https://journals.physiology.org/doi/epdf/10.1152/advan.00094.2018): Assumptions for the following questions: Our idealized cell has an internal concentration of 300mosM.
