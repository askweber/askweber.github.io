When speaking about cell death, we use the terms (And a few others not mentioned): 1. Necrosis 2. Apoptosis 3. Autophagy (Autophagocytosis) All of which describe different mechanisms of cell death. In contrast, when speaking about tissues, we use a few terms including: 1. Atrophy 2. Hypertrophy 3. Hypotrophy 4. Hyperplasia 5. Hypoplasia '-trophy' refers to specifically the size of the cell (And thus organ) '-plasia' refers to the NUMBER of cells (And also thus the organ) Cell death in more detail Cells normally die in a cyclical manner - there's the saying that every cell in the human body replaces itself within 10 years (though not sure how true this is...). Cell death can be programmed or non-programmed . Programmed cell death is physiological , in that it is a normal process of cell function - the fact that it is programmed means it is desired (i.e. it is homeostatic). Non-programmed cell death occurs as a result of insult or injury to the cell and is not desired - it is also less controlled and can impact cells nearby. The main mechanisms of programmed cell death are: Apoptosis (a.k.a Type 1 cell death) Autophagy (a.ka. Type 2 cell death) Others include Activation-induced cell death, oncosis, mitotic catastrophe, immunogenic cell death, pyroptosis, necroptosis (NOT necrosis) The mechanism of non-programmed cell death is: Necrosis Apoptosis Occurs in eukaryotes as a homeostatic process Cells normally are thought to be kept alive by 'survival factors' (i.e. chemicals in its environment which provide a reason for the cell to be kept alive) - what the exact factors are, we don't need to know. From a histological level, we see blebbing (bits of the cell membrane bubbling off), cell shrinkage (loss of cytoplasm and membrane), nuclear fragmentation and DNA(the DNA within the nucleus falls apart), chromatin condensation - essentially, the cell commits suicide. these small fragments are called 'apoptotic bodies' - these float around and are taken up by phagocytes Examples of apoptosis Separation of fingers and toes in the embryo More detail into apoptosis Cells experience stress (intrinsic) or get signals from other cells (extrinsic) to kil themselves -> caspases (a specific protease - an enzyme which breaks down proteins) are activated -> activates more caspases -> destroys proteins within the cell -> destroys the cellular structure -> the cell dies Things that activate the intrinsic pathway: stress hormones (cortisol), head, radiation, viruses, high intracellular Ca2+ The mitochondria as it releases cytochrome c , which activates caspase cascade. Autophagy 'Auto' - self , '-phagy' - eat ; Autophagy is the process of the cell eating itself Pathophysiology The cell forms large vacuoles (pockets within the cytoplasm) which eat the organelles up before it eats the nucleus Macroautophagy - autophagosome/lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic contents, protein aggregates, damaged organelles What activates autophagy Nutrient deprivation Stress, infection, cancer, neurodegeneration, etc. Necrosis Pathophysiology Trauma, infection -> cell damage -> cell membrane erupts (i.e. the cell literally explodes) -> nearby cells are infalmmed If you're interested in understanding these cell mechanisms more, I would recommend starting with the wikipedia article here - if you want to learn more, ask me questions during the ask weber sessions.","title":"Apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis"},{"location":"Mistakes/Cell%20death/#apoptosis-necrosis-necroptosis","text":"","title":"Apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis"},{"location":"Mistakes/Cell%20death/#question","text":"I was asked about different forms of cell death","title":"Question"},{"location":"Mistakes/Cell%20death/#putting-into-perspective","text":"Some words are used to describe death of tissues , and some words are used to describe death of cells .

Expanded answer Osmolarity is a measure of concentration of osmotically active particles in solution - depends on number of particles in a volume of solution (Rather than what the type of particle is) Osmolarity differs from molarity as individual ions contribute to the osmolarity For example: - 1Mol of NaCl in 1 L of water has a molarity of 1mol/L - However in water, $NaCl(aq) \\rightarrow Na^{+}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)$ - This means that the osmolality of this solution is 2 Osmol/L (as NaCl dissociates into 2 ions) - 1 mol of glucose in 1L of water has a molarity of 1mol/L - In water, glucose doesn't deionise, meaning its osmolality is still 1 Osmol/L To define tonicity, you need 2 compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane e.g. a cell in solution Questions (from https://journals.physiology.org/doi/epdf/10.1152/advan.00094.2018): Assumptions for the following questions: Our idealized cell has an internal concentration of 300mosM. (We will continue this assumption through therest of the text, unless otherwise noted.) The solutes present in the cell are assumed to be nonpen-etrating and cannot leave the cell. NaCl is a functionally nonpenetrating solute that behavesas if it cannot cross the cell membrane. (As noted above,in reality, Na+ that leaks into the cell is removed by the Na+-K+-ATPase at a rate that closely matches the rate ofleakage in.) Urea is a freely penetrating solute that easily crosses thecell membrane. Because of this, urea will distribute throughout body compartments until its concentration isequal in all compartments. Water freely crosses all cell membranes, dividing theintracellular and extracellular compartments. Try to answer these questions based on your understandingof osmolarity and tonicity. 1. You place a cell with an internal concentration of 300mosM in a 400 mosM solution. What happens to thevolume and osmolarity of the cell at equilibrium? 2. Which would have a greater effect on the volume of a cellat equilibrium:solution Acomposed of 300 mosM NaCland 200 mosM urea, orsolution Bcomposed of 200mosM NaCl and 300 mosM urea? 3.
