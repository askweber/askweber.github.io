The bacteria that cause tetanus produce a toxin that enters the spinal cord and blocks the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. People who are risk of developing tetanus can be treated with tetanus toxoid and tetanus antitoxin. Tetanus toxoid is a vaccine and tetanus antitoxin contains antibodies against the toxin produced by the bacteria. Why would tetanus toxoid and antitoxin be used together to treat people at risk of developing tetanus? How would their effects differ? Why are boosters of tetanus toxoid required? 10.6.

PKU is caused a a recessive condition that results in a mutated amino acid sequence of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Without this enzyme, the body cannot catabolise phenylalanine in the body, so it accumulates has a toxic effect. In the body, phenylalanine is broken down to another chemical called tyrosine that is used to make several chemicals including adrenaline. If phenylalanine cannot be broken down, there is no tyrosine and therefore no adrenaline. The chance of future children inheriting PKU is of great concern to Daniel\u2019s parents (both unaffected) and they are hesitant to have another child \u2013 so they also seek genetic counselling at the clinic.What advice would you give them if you are doing the genetic counselling? 12.2.

Canvas solutions Design a basic system that allows you to regulate a function in the body. What components are needed and why? 3.2. Canvas solutions What is a negative feedback system? 3.3. Canvas solutions When you stand up after lying down gravity very quickly pulls blood towards your feet and away from your head. As a result, blood delivery to the brain decreases momentarily and you may feel dizzy. What type of feedback system would be best to manage these changes in blood pressure? Where should the sensors be located? What would happen if the system failed to work properly? Ageing and medications can adversely affect the function of this homeostatic system. 3.4. Canvas solutions When we have a fever, our body temperature has increased it in response to chemicals known as pyrogens. Pyrogens are produced by bacteria that infect the body and by the immune cells that combat the infection. The pyrogens act on the hypothalamus, which is the controller for body temperature, and increase the body temperature set point. Explain the process by which fever develops, and the symptoms that we associate with fever. 3.5. Canvas solutions Think about this question-the answer isn't obvious but common sense should help you work it out. Is fever always bad, and should we always treated using drugs? What are the adverse effects of fever and why do they occur? 3.6. Canvas solutions Fever is an increase in body temperature in response to an increase in set point. Hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature to a level that is higher than the setpoint. Would you expect homeostatic systems to respond differently to fever and hyperthermia? 3.7. Canvas solutions What is a second messenger and why is it important? 3.8. Canvas solutions Compare these 2 scenarios. A person has a fever in their body temperature is 40.5\u00b0C. Another person has been locked in a hot car and also has a body temperature of 40.5\u00b0C. They have hyperthermia. What is the difference between these cases? 3.9. Canvas solutions In a previous module you looked at the role of the cell membrane. One of its functions is to control the movement of molecules between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, and its chemical structure helps it to perform that function. Because of its lipid core, molecules that are polar do not pass easily through the cell membrane. Insulin is an important molecule that affects cell function. The exterior of the molecule is mainly polar, whereas the interior is mainly non-polar. Will insulin be able to pass freely through the cell membrane and if not, how does it influence cell function? 3.10. Canvas solutions Adrenaline is a protein (polar) hormone that increases blood pressure. Excessively high blood pressure damages the cardiovascular system and other body systems. Elevated blood pressure is an important cause of renal disease and cognitive dysfunction. How could we use our knowledge of adrenaline in the way that it interacts with cells in the treatment of high blood pressure? 3.11. Canvas solutions Cortisol is a lipid soluble molecule that plays an important role in many homeostatic processes. Do you think that cortisol will be able to pass through the cell membrane? Where are the receptors for cortisol likely to be found in the cell? Formulate a general rule for the location of receptors. 3.12. Canvas solutions Below is a flow chart showing how the secretion of cortisol is controlled. This is a classic negative feedback system. Both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland measure the amount of cortisol in the blood. To increase cortisol production in the adrenal gland, the hypothalamus releases the hormone GnRH. GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary to increase the release of the hormone ACTH. ACTH acts on the adrenal gland to increase the production of cortisol. Failure to produce adequate amounts of cortisol causes Addison's disease which is a life-threatening condition. Addison's disease could be the result of problems in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary or adrenal gland. Use the flowchart to explain how you would identify the likely site of dysfunction in a patient with Addison's disease. 3.13. Canvas solutions Drugs that mimic the effects of cortisol are commonly prescribed to treat inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic conditions. These drugs are commonly called corticosteroids or glucocorticoids and include prednisolone, prednisone, dexamethasone and betamethasone. Although each of these drugs has a different molecular structure they all work in the same general way and mimic the effects of cortisol. What do you think is common between each of these drugs and cortisol that enables them to function in this way? 3.14. Canvas solutions The name ACTH is an abbreviation for adrenocorticotrophic hormone. A trophic hormone is a hormone that stimulates growth in another gland-in this case the adrenal cortex which is the site of cortisol production.Corticosteroids for a period of time, it is dangerous to suddenly stop treatment. Why do you think it is dangerous, and what strategy could you use to minimise the risk? 3.15. Canvas solutions Explain the role of oxytocin in childbirth. What sort of feedback system is operating in this example and why? 3.16. Canvas solutions What do we mean when we talk about the osmolarity of the blood and why does it matter? 3.17. Canvas solutions Severe head injury can result in swelling of the brain. This is a very serious condition because the brain is entirely contained within the bony skull-it has nowhere to go when it swells so the intracranial pressure increases. Mannitol is a simple sugar that can be administered in intravenous fluids to reduce intracranial pressure. Using your knowledge of osmolarity, try to describe how mannitol exerts its effect. 3.18. Canvas solutions Diuretics are drugs that increase urine production. Many diuretics exert their effect by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the kidney tubules. In other words the concentration of sodium ions in the urine is increased. Usual knowledge of osmolality to explain why diuresis occurs. 3.19. Canvas solutions There is a common perception that we should drink as much water as we can while we are exercising. However, excessive water can Adversely affect exercise performance and cause problems like headache, altered levels of consciousness, and swelling of the hands legs and feet. Why would these changes occur in what could be done to prevent them? 3.20. Canvas solutions In previous questions you have looked at the way in which insulin interacts with receptors on the surface of the cell to change cellular function. Glucose homeostasis is dependent on having adequate amounts of insulin available, and adequate receptors to interact with the insulin. How does the cell know when insulin has combined with its receptor, and how is that information used to change cell function? 3.21. Canvas solutions In previous modules you have looked at the role of the cell membrane, cell membrane channels, membrane pumps, and differences between the concentrations of sodium and potassium ions in the intracellular and extracellular fluid. Can you unify these ideas to explain how the cell action potentials occur? 3.22. Canvas solutions Why do we need a homeostatic system to regulate blood glucose concentration? 3.23. Canvas solutions Glucose is a water soluble molecule and in previous questions you have looked at the fact that water soluble molecules do not passed directly through the cell membrane because of lipid core. How can we enable glucose absorption from the gut, glucose entry into the cells and glucose reabsorption in the kidneys? 3.24. Canvas solutions Use your answer to the previous question to explain how we could we apply our knowledge of glucose transport in the kidneys in the management of diabetes mellitus. 3.25. Canvas solutions How can we store glucose in cells? 3.26. Canvas solutions How does glucose storage in the cells contribute to glucose homeostasis? 3.27. Canvas solutions Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes mellitus. Why does diabetic ketoacidosis occur and what effects would it have on the body? 3.28. Canvas solutions The ketogenic diet is currently popular. How would the ketogenic diet work? Look at the chemical reaction below. This is the carbonic anhydrase reaction that occurs in many cells in the body. It is very useful reaction to remember. \\( \\(H^+ + HCO_3^- \\leftarrow\\rightarrow H_2O + CO_2\\) \\) A homeostatic mechanism in our body keeps the carbon dioxide levels in the blood stable by increasing ventilation (i.e. respiratory efforts) when carbon dioxide levels increase. Why is this necessary? What effect would diabetic ketoacidosis have on respiration? 3.29. Canvas solutions Why can we compare the glomerulus to a soaker hose? 3.30 Canvas solutions Why do we need the tubule system in our kidneys? 3.31. Canvas solutions Imagine you are a potter trying to turn a lump of clay into a delicate, precise shape. What would you do first, and what would you do subsequently? Applied the same thinking to explain what happens to filtrate as it passes through the renal tubules. 3.32. Canvas solutions In order to control the amount of glomerular filtration that is occurring the pressure inside the glomerular capillary must be regulated. Blood flows into the glomerular capillaries through the afferent arteriole and flows from the glomerular capillary into the efferent arteriole. We are able to change the diameter of the arterioles. How would this help us to regulate glomerular filtration? 3.33. Canvas solutions One action of the Loop of Henle is to make the renal medulla hyperosmotic. Why is this important in renal function (there is no active transport mechanism for water in the body)? We need to regulate water reabsorption to maintain homeostasis. How could we do this and how is this example analogous to another example that you have looked at? 3.34. Canvas solutions Diuretics are drugs that increase water excretion in the kidneys. They are useful for the treatment of conditions like heart failure. In heart failure the volume of blood in the body is often increased. This occurs to maintain blood pressure in the face of decreasing cardiac function, but it can have adverse effects in various tissues. There are a number of different diuretics that are available. For each of the following examples explain why they have their diuretic effect. Loop diuretics decrease the reabsorption of sodium in the loop of Henle. Spironolactone blocks the effect of aldosterone in the collecting duct. 3.35. Canvas solutions Diabetes insipidus is a condition where people excretes excessive amounts of very dilute urine. It is caused by an endocrine abnormality. What abnormality would cause diabetes insipidus? How does this relate to the increased urination that occurs when people drink large amounts of alcohol? 3.36. Canvas solutions In previous modules you have looked at the role of the cell membrane, cell membrane channels, membrane pumps, and differences between the concentrations of sodium and potassium ions in the intracellular and extracellular fluid. Can you unify these ideas to explain how the cell membrane potential is generated? 3.37.","title":"Daily questions for Session 3"},{"location":"Daily%20questions/Daily%20questions%20for%20Session%203/#daily-questions-for-session-3","text":"What is meant by the term homeostasis and why does it matter? 3.1.

Using your knowledge of how action potentials occur, and in particular the role of cell membrane channels, suggest how local anaesthetics could exert their effect. 4.1. Canvas solution Using your knowledge of neurotransmitters, suggest how general anaesthetics may exert their effect. 4.2. Canvas solution Myasthenia gravis is a disease caused when acetylcholine (Ach) receptors on the post synaptic side of the neuromuscular junction are destroyed. What is the role of acetylcholine in muscle function? Insecticides kill insects by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine. As a result the insects have uncontrolled muscle contractions and effectively dive exhaustion. How could acetylcholinesterase inhibitors people with myasthenia gravis? 4.3. Canvas solution Cholera is an important cause of infectious diarrhoea and death. The disease is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . The toxin exerts its effect by binding to receptors on small intestinal cells, stimulating production of the second messenger cAMP inside the cells. This opens a chloride channel in the membrane and as a result negatively charged chloride ions are able to move out of the cell. Cholera causes severe diarrhoea which results in severe dehydration and hyponatraemia. Treatment for cholera involves the administration of fluids which replace both water and electrolytes. Use your knowledge of SGLTs to explain why patients do better with oral fluids that contain sodium and glucose than fluids that contain only sodium. 4.4. Canvas solution Many Australian snake toxins block post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors and therefore cause paralysis. Red Back spider venom depletes presynaptic stores of acetylcholine, meaning that neuromuscular transmission cannot occur. Funnel Web Spider toxin prevents the closure of Na+ channels resulting in ongoing action potentials in autonomic and motor neurones. Funnel-web spider toxin affects mammals, but primates are especially susceptible. No one is really sure why, but it may be due to differences in the structure and function of ion channels between different animals. In insects, which are the intended target of toxin, it exerts its effect by binding to K+ and Ca2+ channels. Blue ringed octopus toxin blocks Na+ channels to prevent action potential transmission, especially in in peripheral nerves, resulting in muscle paralysis. When the muscles of the diaphragm and the chest wall are affected, respiratory failure develops. The toxin is not produced by the octopus itself; it comes from bacteria that live in the salivary glands of the octopus in a symbiotic relationship. The toxin in blue ringed octopus saliva is the same as the toxin in puffer fish which has killed many people in Japan.","title":"Daily questions for Session 4"},{"location":"Daily%20questions/Daily%20questions%20for%20Session%204/#daily-questions-for-session-4","text":"Information from the nociceptors in the tissue is transmitted to the brain where information is interpreted as pain.

Answer The simplest way to describe the cell membrane is as a phospholipid bilayer. Bilayer means 2 layers, and there are 2 layers of phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane. The term phospholipid refers to the structure of the molecule-it is made up of a phosphate head and 2 lipid tails. The phosphate head is negatively charged (so can be described as polar) which makes it hydrophilic (hydro-refers to water and -philic means loving). The phosphate head wants to be in contact with water so it faces the intracellular in the extracellular fluid. The lipid tails are uncharged (nonpolar) which makes them hydrophobic. This means that they don't want to be near water. They are located in the centre of the bilayer. The chemical and physical characteristics of the bilayer makes it a semipermeable membrane. This means that some things can pass through it easily whereas others cannot. The molecules that can pass freely through the cell membrane are lipophilic (which means water soluble molecules are unable to pass directly-the membrane is impermeable to these molecules). Another name for the cell membrane is the plasma membrane.","title":"1.1.

What is the difference in roles of the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and what makes the rough endoplasmic reticulum rough? The endoplasmic reticulum is located inside the cells. The prefix endo- means inside (endocrine hormones are released inside the body, endovascular procedures are performed inside blood vessels). A reticulum is a network.The photograph of an Australian reticulated pipe and below shows the way its markings form a network across its skin. It's that network of markings that gives it the name \"reticulated\". The endoplasmic reticulum is located inside the cells. It is the largest organelle in the cell. An organelle is a structure inside the cell that performs a specific function (s). The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of protein synthesis and transport, lipid and steroid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and calcium storage. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is made up of sealed sacs with ribosomes on their surface. It's the ribosomes that give the organelle its a rough appearance when it is viewed with a microscope. Ribosomes are the organelles that are responsible for the assembly of proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is mainly involved in manufacturing lipids, a process that doesn\u2019t require ribosomes.","title":"1.2.

If you are having trouble visualising this, think about what happens when oil is added to water. Can you suggest a physiological process where this might be important? A phospholipid molecule has a phosphate head that is attracted to water (hydrophilic) and two lipid tails that are hydrophobic. When phospholipids are added to water they arrange themselves into phospholipid bilayers into 'balls' called micelles, into liposomes Micelles are formed in the small intestine as fats in our diet are digested. They move through the watery intestinal contents and come in contact with the cells lining the intestine. They can then be absorbed into the cells by simple diffusion. Liposomes are carriers for targeted drug delivery. They help to obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake of drugs. Steps involved in liposome action of drug delivery: 1. Adsorption: Adsorption of liposomes to cell membranes causes its contact on the cell membrane. 2. Endocytosis: Adsorption of liposomes on the cell surface membrane followed by engulfment and internalization into the liposomes 3. Fusion : fusion of lipid bilayers of liposomes with the lipoidal cell membrane by lateral diffusion and intermingling of lipids results in direct delivery of liposomal contents in the cytoplasm. 4. Lipid exchange : Due to the similarity of liposomal lipid membrane with cell membrane phospholipids, lipid transfer proteins in the cell membrane easily recognize liposomes and cause lipid exchange. For example, in case of cancer cells; they consume large amounts of fats to fill the requirement of rapid growth, they recognize the liposomes (loaded with anti-cancer drug) as a potential source of nutrition. When they are targeted by liposome, they get absorbed. Once the anti-cancer drugs are released from the liposome into the site, cancer cells are killed by the drug.","title":"1.3.

What different types of channels exist and why are the different types important? Channel proteins are pores (or tunnels) that enable ions to diffuse through the cell membrane into or out of the cell. Some channels are open all the time, allowing continuous free movement. Others are gated, meaning that movement through them is controlled. This is important in physiological functions such as the action potential used by nerves to transmit information. In nerves, it is the gated sodium and potassium channels that are most important. Each ion has its own channel through which it passes - there are separate Na and K channels in the membrane.

In broad terms, what effects do think channelopathies have (i.e. what symptoms would they produce)? Membrane channels play an essential role in cell membrane function, and the cell membrane plays an essential role in cell function. Channelopathies will affect membrane and therefore cell function. The symptoms that are produced will depend on the channels that are affected, their role in the cell, and the function of the cell in the body. Movement of ions through cell membrane channels creates electrical currents and generates the membrane potential essential for the production of action potentials in nerves and contraction of muscles (you will hear more about this later in the semester) and other functions such as signal transduction, neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion, volume regulation, growth and motility. In the muscle they can cause problems ranging from myotonia (muscle hyperexcitability) to flaccid paralysis (muscle hypoexcitability). Channelopathies in the heart cause sudden death due to irregular electrical activity, and are probably contribute to many cases of SIDS.","title":"1.5.

Diffusion is a process in which ions or molecules move down their concentration gradient (i.e. from an area of higher to an area of lower concentration). The concentration gradient drives the movement, so no energy is required. Because no energy is required, diffusion is described as a passive process. If they have the appropriate chemical structure, molecules can dive views directly through the cell membrane. Because of the chemical nature ions can't directly diffuse through the cell membrane they can diffuse through membrane channels. Larger molecules such as glucose need to be assisted through the cell membrane and this assistance is given by proteins carriers that physically pick molecule up on one side of the membrane and release it on the other. Because this is occurring down the concentration gradient and how energy is required this is still an example of diffusion, but in this case the carrier is helping (or facilitating) the process so it is known as facilitated diffusion. Active transport occurs when carriers pump ions against their concentration gradient (i.e. from their lower to higher concentration). Any pump needs a source of energy to function and the cell membrane carriers are no different. They are using the molecule ATP to power the transport, so this process is known as active transport.","title":"1.6.

Following assembly, ribosomes are transported to the cell cytoplasm where they serve as the sites for protein synthesis. golgi apparatus - A cell organelle that helps process and package proteins and lipid molecules, especially proteins destined to be exported from the cell. Named after its discoverer, Camillo Golgi, the Golgi body appears as a series of stacked membranes. endoplasmic reticulum - Endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes inside a cell through which proteins and other molecules move. Proteins are assembled at organelles called ribosomes. When proteins are destined to be part of the cell membrane or exported from the cell, the ribosomes assembling them attach to the endoplasmic reticulum, giving it a rough appearance. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and helps synthesize and concentrate various substances needed by the cell. mitochondrion - Mitochondria generate most of the ATP used by cells to drive reactions that require an input of free energy. Each organelle performs the same set of basic functions in all cell types. But to serve the specialized functions of cells, these organelles will vary in abundance and can have additional properties that differ from cell type to cell type.","title":"1.9.

The bone marrow is the location of the stem cells that produce all of the cells of the immune system. Some of those cells contribute to innate immunity which provides non-specific protection. In other words innate immune system responds to any foreign cell in the body. The stem cells that produce the cells in the innate immune system are known as the myeloid progenitor cells. The lymphoid progenitor cells give rise to the lymphocytes which make up the adaptive immune system.

Immunity can be assessed by measuring antibody levels in the blood. If a person has been infected with a disease and mounted an immune response they will have antibodies in the blood. They will also have antibodies if they have been vaccinated. It can be impossible to differentiate infected cases from vaccinated cases. This can be important in animal biosecurity. Measurement of antibody levels doesn't enable differentiation between animals that have been exposed (and are therefore potential carriers of disease) from those that have been vaccinated. Responses to vaccines vary from person to person. Some people will develop protective immunity while others will not. A good example is hepatitis B vaccination which is routine for health care workers in Australia. Some people fail to respond to vaccination. They can be identified by the low levels of antibodies in the blood.","title":"10.10.

Why don't autoimmune diseases occur more commonly? An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system mounts an attack against its own cells. There are many factors that contribute to autoimmune diseases, with genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors all playing a role. Lymphocytes have receptors that recognize a vast number of antigens, although individual lymphocytes will only identify one specific antigen. A lymphocyte that recognises a \"self\" antigen-an antigen on a cell that is a normal part of the body-it will not initiate an immune response. The lymphocytes learn which antigens are self early on fetal development. This is known as immune tolerance. If on the other hand the lymphocyte identifies a nonself antigen it will initiate an appropriate response. Autoimmune diseases occur when tolerance fails. Autoimmune diseases don't occur commonly because the immune system is very good at differentiating self from nonself. However, autoimmune diseases affect almost 10% of people in Western societies with women being far more commonly affected than men.","title":"10.2.

During the first critical hours and days of exposure to a new pathogen, we rely on our innate immune system to protect us from infection. Innate immunity depends on a group of proteins and phagocytic cells that recognise consistent features of pathogens and become quickly activated to help destroy them. The innate immune system produces a standardised response against any foreign material entering the body. There are many aspects of this response, some of which are directed at destroying the foreign material and others at stimulating activity in the acquired immune system. Phagocytes are important cells in the innate immune system that can scavenge and ingest microbes to destroy them. The exocytes, which include the eosinophils, mast cells and basophils, produce chemicals that can destroy microbes. Chemicals known as cytokines, which enable communication between different cells, also play an important role in innate immunity. The cells also produce chemicals that stimulate the inflammatory response. Part of the inflammatory response involves dilation of blood vessels which increases blood flow to the inflamed area and allows chemicals produced by the immune system is to enter the tissues together with cells of the innate immune system such as neutrophils. The innate immune system: the first line of defense The innate immune system is the first part of the body to detect invaders such as viruses, bacteria, parasites and toxins, or to sense wounds or trauma. Upon detection of these agents or events, the innate immune system activates cells to attack and destroy the outsider, or to initiate repair, while also informing and modulating the adaptive immune response that follows this first line of defense.","title":"10.3.

T_he roles of the adaptive immune system are suggested by the different names by which it is known. In addition to adaptive immunity it is also known as specific immunity or acquired immunity. Describing this part of the immune system as adaptive indicates that it can change the way in which it responds to foreign antigens. Each individual cell that is part of the adaptive immune system will only respond 21 antigen-hence the immune system is specific. The adaptive immune response is much stronger when the adaptive immune system encounters an antigen it has met previously-hence it is the acquired immune system._ The cells of the adaptive immune system are the lymphocytes. Lymphocytes have very specific receptors on their surface that enables them to recognise different molecules and microbes. The lymphocytes perform a variety of functions-they can destroy foreign cells or infected or abnormal cells in the body. They can produce antibodies which play an important role in immune protection and they can link different components of the adaptive and innate immune systems. When exposed to a foreign antigen some lymphocytes become memory cells which remain in the body and enable a rapid and powerful in response to be launched against a previously identified foreign antigen. The adaptive immune system: the second, specific response Adaptive immune cells are the second and specific line of defense, and they are called to action by the innate immune system. After recognizing the invader, the cells can multiply and combat it, leading to recovery from disease and protection against its return.","title":"10.4. Canvas solution"},{"location":"Daily%20questions%20solutions/10.5.%20Canvas%20solution/","text":"What are the two types of adaptive immune responses? The humoral immune response uses antibodies produced by B lymphocytes (or B cells). The B cells release the antibodies into the extracellular fluid where microbes can be located. The antibodies combine with antigens on the surface of the microbes and the combination of antigen and antibody makes it easier to eliminate the microbe. A key part of the response to vaccine is to stimulate production of antibodies which will circulate in the blood and respond immediately if the microbe against which the person was vaccinated is identified in the body. Cell-mediated immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes (T cells). There are several types of T cells including helper T cells which coordinate various immune functions and killer T cells, which destroy cells infected with a virus. Helper T cells can stimulate antibody production by B cells, stimulate activity in killer T cells and increase activity in phagocytes. So they are increasing activity in different parts of the acquired immune system and linking innate and acquired immunity.","title":"10.5.

The bacteria that cause tetanus produce a toxin that enters the spinal cord and blocks the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. People who are risk of developing tetanus can be treated with tetanus toxoid and tetanus antitoxin. Tetanus toxoid is a vaccine and tetanus antitoxin contains antibodies against the toxin produced by the bacteria. Why would tetanus toxoid and antitoxin be used together to treat people at risk of developing tetanus? How would their effects differ? Why are boosters of tetanus toxoid required? Because the tetanus toxin blocks the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA it enables uncontrolled muscle contraction to occur. The uncontrolled muscle contraction is characteristic of tetanus and is the origin of its old name of \"lockjaw\". If an unvaccinated person is treated with tetanus toxoid their acquired immune system will be stimulated to produce an immune response. However, the initial immune response will be quite slow, and by the time it has a strong protective effect the tetanus bacteria may have produced enough toxin to kill the patient. The antitoxin contains antibodies which bind to the toxin and prevent it from having its effect. The antitoxin can therefore provide protection in people who have not been vaccinated. Over time, immune memory can fade and that is why booster vaccinations are required for many diseases.","title":"10.6.

These circulating antibodies can combine with virus circulating in the bloodstream and neutralise it before it has the chance to infect cells and cause disease. Because the immune system is not directly contributing to protection in this scenario, this is known as passive immunity.

Meiosis is a 2 division process that produces 4 cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell from which they were formed ie. one copy of each chromosome. The chromosomes will not be exact copies of the chromosomes in the parent cell because crossing over occurs to allow exchange of DNA between chromosomes.

What is menopause and why doe sit occur? Why don't men experience an equivalent event? Menopause is the permanent cessation of menses (periods). At menopause, a woman's ovaries have run out of primary oocytes. A woman does not produce oocytes after birth. The oocytes will develop into a variant follicles which will ultimately produce eggs. Only some of the oocytes that form in the embryo will survive to birth, and they will exist in the ovary as primary follicles. Only small percentage of the primary follicles will ever develop into secondary follicles that will ultimately produce an egg. Once the primary follicles are depleted no more secondary follicle formation can occur. This affects the balance of hormones in the body and ultimately leads to the cessation of menstruation. It also leads to a number of other very unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes. Decreased oestrogen production also increases bone reabsorption by osteoclasts potentially leading to the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

In what type of cell would a mutation that resulted in a heritable tumour occur? Why are only some tumours heritable? For a tumour to be passed from one generation to the next the tumour causing mutation must occur in a germ cell that is used to produce eggs or sperm. If the mutation occurs in a non-germ cell it cannot be passed to future generations. However, the mutation will be passed on to the cells that are formed by mitotic division of the mutation containing cell and as a result the number of mutation containing cells in the body will progressively increase. Mutations frequently occur during mitosis but they are generally corrected by DNA repair mechanisms in the cell.

PKU is caused a a recessive condition that results in a mutated amino acid sequence of an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Without this enzyme, the body cannot catabolise phenylalanine in the body, so it accumulates has a toxic effect. In the body, phenylalanine is broken down to another chemical called tyrosine that is used to make several chemicals including adrenaline. If phenylalanine cannot be broken down, there is no tyrosine and therefore no adrenaline. The chance of future children inheriting PKU is of great concern to Daniel\u2019s parents (both unaffected) and they are hesitant to have another child \u2013 so they also seek genetic counselling at the clinic.What advice would you give them if you are doing the genetic counselling? Phenylketonuria is a recessive condition so Daniel must have received one copy of the disease-causing gene from both his parents. Only a child with 2 copies of the gene will have the disease. His parents may be unaffected because they have only one copy of the gene each-in this case they are known as carriers. In theory there is a 25% chance of 2 carriers producing a child with PKU. However, there is no guarantee that that will occur. Each time a child is conceived it receives genes from the egg and sperm, and the genes that it receives a not influenced in any way by the genes that were passed to previously conceived children. These 2 carriers could go on to have 10 children, all or none of whom could have PKU. There is no way of predicting whether an embryo will be homozygotes for the PKU gene and therefore have PKU once it is born. Post conception genetic testing could identify a homozygotes embryo thus putting the parents in the position where they need to decide what to do about the pregnancy. Alternatively, artificial reproduction techniques could be used to identify eggs that don't have the disease gene and those eggs could be used in procedures like in vitro fertilisation to produce a child who did not have PKU.","title":"12.2.

Although statistically there is a 25% chance of a child of parents who are cystic fibrosis carriers developing the disease, in this example both children have been affected. This is possible because the genes acquired at conception of one child are not affected in any way by the genes that have been inherited by previous children. The daughter can be less severely affected than the son because of variable penetrance. Variation in penetrance means that people who have the same gene is present (genotype) will not necessarily have the same level of disease-in other words there phenotypes will vary. This tells us that simply looking at the genes that a person has may not give us the full story about their risk of developing disease.","title":"12.3.

Homeostasis has become the central unifying concept of physiology and is defined as a self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. Homeostasis is not static and unvarying; it is a dynamic process that can change internal conditions as required to survive external challenges. (Billman, G. E. (2020). Homeostasis: the underappreciated and far too often ignored central organizing principle of physiology. _Frontiers in Physiology , 200.)_ _Homeostasis denotes the maintenance, or regulation, of vital internal variables in a state of relative constancy. Automatic cellular mechanisms, neural and endocrine controls, and behavior all contribute importantly to homeostasis. Organisms that function in wider ranges of external environments tend to regulate more internal variables and to have more complex systems regulating important variables \u2013 for example, the adaptable mechanisms with which we mammals regulate body temperature allow us to function in a much wider range of external temperatures than reptiles. Most physiological homeostatic mechanisms rely on negative feedback; that is, signals related to the regulated variable are sensed and cause the system to react in a way that reduces the signals. (_Asarian et al. Homeostasis. Encyclopedia of Human Behavior (Second Edition), 2012). So homeostasis matters because it allows us to continue functioning in a wide variety of environments and to cope with changing demands.","title":"3.1.

The exterior of the molecule is mainly polar, whereas the interior is mainly non-polar. Will insulin be able to pass freely through the cell membrane and if not, how does it influence cell function? Insulin is unable to pass through the cell membrane so it must communicate with the cell from the outside. It does this by combining with receptors on the surface of the cell.

Osmolality indicates the concentration of all the particles dissolved in the body fluid (wherever in the body it is located). Higher osmolality indicates a higher concentration of particles (and as a result a lower concentration of water). Water can move between fluid compartments in the body e.g. between the intracellular and extracellular fluid. Provided the membrane separating the compartments is permeable to water, water moves from the compartment of low osmolality to the compartment of high osmolality. Another way of looking at this is to say that water is moving from the area or its concentration is higher (i.e. osmolality is lower) to the area where its concentration is lower-it is moving down its concentration gradient. When water moves between plasma and intracellular compartments, the movement direction depends on both compartments' osmolalities.

When administered intravenously the mannitol becomes a new solute in the plasma. Because mannitol is a sugar and is therefore water soluble it can't across the cell membrane and remains in the blood. Because the mannitol is a new socket and is therefore increased the number of solutes in the blood, it attracts water from the intracellular fluid into the blood plasma. The water then travels to the kidneys where it gets excreted. The mannitol causes the cells in the brain to dehydrate mildly. In effect, the mannitol is causing the cells of the brain to dehydrate slightly.

Can you unify these ideas to explain how the cell membrane potential is generated?

If sodium and potassium ions are going to move through the cell membrane they will move through gated channels. They can only get through the membrane when those channels are open. There is a concentration gradient for sodium and potassium ions favouring the movement of potassium ions out of the cell in the movement of sodium ions into it. A small number of potassium channels are always open allowing potassium leakage out of the cell, and a small number of sodium channels open allowing potassium to enter it. Because there are more potassium ions leaving the cell than sodium ions entering it the interior of the cell develops a negative charge compared to the outside of the cell. This charge difference is maintained by the role of the sodium potassium ATPase pump which is continuously pumping 3 sodium ions back out of the cell and at the same time pumping 2 potassium ions back into it. Eventually the negative charge inside the cell opposes the exit of potassium ions.

In previous questions you have looked at the idea that the cell membrane potential depends on the pumping action of the Na-K ATPase carrier in the cell membrane.

The higher than normal concentration of glucose molecules in the blood causes an osmotic effect that shifts water in the body.

Hyperglycemia can be due to reduced insulin secretion, decreased glucose utilization, or increased glucose production.

The channels are like tunnels through the cell membrane through which ions can pass down their concentration gradient. The channels can be open all the time or gated. Gated channels will only allow ions to pass when the channels are open. Carriers can physically move ions and molecules through the cell membrane. If the movement is down the concentration gradient, and the carriers are simply helping the process, this is known as facilitated diffusion.

They are useful for the treatment of conditions like heart failure. In heart failure the volume of blood in the body is often increased. This occurs to maintain blood pressure in the face of decreasing cardiac function, but it can have adverse effects in various tissues. There are a number of different diuretics that are available. For each of the following examples explain why they have their diuretic effect. Loop diuretics decrease the reabsorption of sodium in the loop of Henle. Spironolactone blocks the effect of aldosterone in the collecting duct. By blocking the reabsorption of sodium in the Loop of Henle, the Loop diuretics reduce the osmolarity of the renal medulla. This decreases the ability to reabsorb water in the more distal parts of the tubule system. If less water is reabsorbed more water will remain in the filtrate and be excreted from the body. Aldosterone controls the insertion of the sodium channels in the collecting duct. In the collecting duct water is reabsorbed when it follows sodium ions into the cell. So decreasing sodium reabsorption will decrease water reabsorption. Another role of sodium is to increase the activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase in the cell membrane. This is important because the pump is continuously removing sodium from the cell and returning it into the blood. This keeps the sodium concentration in the cell low and allows sodium and therefore water reabsorption to continue. Blocking aldosterone will decrease the activity in the pump and therefore decrease water reabsorption.","title":"3.35.

It is caused by an endocrine abnormality. What abnormality would cause diabetes insipidus? How does this relate to the increased urination that occurs when people drink large amounts of alcohol? Diabetes is a condition that increases urine production. Diabetes mellitus means sweet urine, and the urine is sweet because it contains large amounts of glucose. Diabetes insipidus basically means weak or insipid urine-the urine is very dilute. In ancient Greece, physicians differentiated the conditions by tasting the urine. Today we have different ways of differentiating them. In diabetes insipidus the urine is dilutive because water is not being reabsorbed in the collecting duct. This is the result of inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which is responsible for inserting the water channels (aquaporins) in the collecting ducts. Without those water channels the capacity to reabsorb water is significantly reduced. More water stays in the body, so the blood volume increases. When the blood volume increases blood pressure increases, so low blood pressure is an important trigger for antidiuretic hormone release. Antidiuretic hormone also causes constriction of the blood vessels which is another way in which blood pressure can be increased. Because of this effect antidiuretic hormone is also known as vasopressin vaso refers to blood vessels pressin refers to increasing blood pressure","title":"3.36.

Where should the sensors be located? What would happen if the system failed to work properly? Ageing and medications can adversely affect the function of this homeostatic system. We need to ensure that we have adequate blood pressure to maintain blood flow to the brain. Standing up reduces the pressure in the blood vessels supplying the brain, so the blood pressure is now too low. We need to get the blood pressure back to normal to maintain adequate blood flow. In homeostatic terms what has happened is that the controlled variable (the blood pressure) has fallen below the setpoint and needs to be returned to the setpoint. The best system to do this would be a negative feedback system. The best place to measure blood pressure would be in the vessels that are delivering the blood to the brain, and important sensors are located in these vessels (but because we want an overall picture of blood pressure in the body senses are located in many additional places in the body). If the system failed to work properly you would experience prolonged dizziness, and possibly even faint. That would increase the risk of falling, which is an important problem in older people.

Explain the process by which fever develops, and the symptoms that we associate with fever. A: The pyrogens reach the hypothalamus where they change the setpoint (fever is also known as pyrexia). Although the body temperature is that the value that is considered normal, it is below the current set point, and so the negative feedback system begins increasing body temperature to the new set point. Even though your body temperature is apparently normal, you will still feel cold and you will shiver in order to generate heat. Q: When we have a fever, our body temperature has increased it in response to chemicals known as pyrogens. Pyrogens are produced by bacteria that infect the body and by the immune cells that combat the infection. The pyrogens act on the hypothalamus, which is the controller for body temperature, and increase the body temperature set point. Explain the process by which fever develops, and the symptoms that we associate with fever. A: In fever there is an increase in the set point for body temperature. Although the person's body temperature is initially at the level considered normal, it is below the set point, so the negative feedback system operates to increase body temperature to the new set point. When the patient's body temperature is below the set point a person will feel cold, even if their temperature is higher than normal. Shivering helps to increase body temperature because the conversion of energy released during ATP breakdown (the energy that powers muscle contraction) is quite inefficient. Only some of the energy goes to muscle contraction and the rest generates heat. Pyrogens are not the only things that change the set point. There is a diurnal variation - the body temperature of a healthy person increases by about 0.5\u00b0 - 1.0\u00b0C from morning to late afternoon. Body temperature also tends to be higher in women than in men and is approximately 0.4\u00b0C higher during the second half of the menstrual cycle compared with the first.

Is fever always bad, and should we always treated using drugs? What are the adverse effects of fever and why do they occur? A: Fever is a physiological response to a challenge. It makes sense to think that if our body has developed the response it must have some beneficial effects. Increasing the body temperature does increase our ability to destroy bacteria and viruses, and so routinely suppressing any fever does not make sense. We can suppress fever using drugs that have an antipyretic affect. The pyrogens that increase the setpoint in the hypothalamus do so by inducing the production of prostaglandins. We can block prostaglandin production using commonly available drugs that are known as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). We know that regulation of body temperature is important for the maintenance of normal cell function, so an adverse effect of fever is to impair cell function. This can lead to serious consequences such as seizures, which are most common in infants, but can occur in people of any age. It therefore makes perfect sense to try to lower body temperature in cases of severe fevers. Q: Think about this question-the answer isn't obvious but common sense should help you work it out. Is fever always bad, and should we always treated using drugs? What are the adverse effects of fever and why do they occur? A: Because fever is a response that has evolved in our body makes sense to think that it is of some benefit. Increasing body temperature appears to slow viral replication and to increase the efficiency of the immune system by enabling immune cells to arrive at infection sites more quickly and to improve the activation of many cells contributing to immunity. But fee that also has disadvantages. It significantly increases the metabolic rate meaning that we are breaking down resources more quickly and can cause cell death. Young children are particularly susceptible to the effects of fever and can develop seizures when their body temperature increases. Currently there is debate in the medical world about whether fever should be treated. Studies have shown that deciding not to treat moderate fever does not result in worse outcomes, but is not yet known whether it improves recovery. This is not the only example of important physiological processes potentially causing damage in the body. The immune response is vital but an excessive response causes tissue damage and possibly death. Patients with severe pneumonia may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs to limit ongoing lung damage. The physiological responses to failing heart function help keep us alive in the short term, but in the longer term may hasten death.","title":"3.6.

Another person has been locked in a hot car and also has a body temperature of 40.5\u00b0C. They have hyperthermia. What is the difference between these cases? In the first scenario body temperature has increased because the hypothalamic setpoint increased. The increase in temperature was brought about by the body increasing heat retention and heat generation. Although the body temperature is higher than normal, the increase can be considered appropriate because the body temperature is at the setpoint. In the 2nd scenario body temperature is higher than the setpoint. The negative feedback systems that control body temperature have been unable to restore it to the desired value. Because the body temperature is higher than it should be this is a case of hyperthermia. Although they both result in an increase in body temperature, fever and hyperthermia are 2 entirely different processes. Another good example of the difference comes from the control of ventilation. If we exercise or increase carbon dioxide generation in the body and we increase ventilation in order to increase carbon dioxide removal. Under those circumstances the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood remains at the normal level. However if we are hyperventilating our ventilation is excessively high, and the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood fall below normal.","title":"3.9.

The disease is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . The toxin exerts its effect by binding to receptors on small intestinal cells, stimulating production of the second messenger cAMP inside the cells. This opens a chloride channel in the membrane and as a result negatively charged chloride ions are able to move out of the cell. Cholera causes severe diarrhoea which results in severe dehydration and hyponatraemia. Treatment for cholera involves the administration of fluids which replace both water and electrolytes. Use your knowledge of SGLTs to explain why patients do better with oral fluids that contain sodium and glucose than fluids that contain only sodium. Cholera opens chloride channels in the membrane and as a result negatively charged chloride ions are able to move out of the cell. Positively charged sodium ions follow down the electrical gradient that is created. The high concentration of ions outside the cells makes water leave the cell by osmosis, resulting in severe diarrhoea. Deaths due to cholera have decreased since the introduction of oral rehydration therapy. Oral rehydration therapy involves getting patients to drink a solution with the aim of replacing water and ions that have been lost. The key to successful oral rehydration is for the solution to also contain glucose. Glucose is important because the reabsorption of sodium in the intestinal occurs using a sodium-glucose cotransporter. Sodium won\u2019t be reabsorbed unless glucose is also available for co-transport. As sodium is reabsorbed into the cells, water follows by osmosis.","title":"4.4.

The description of something as a \u201csteroid\u201d simply refers to the chemical shape of the molecule. There are 2 types of steroid molecules that are often talked about. It is very likely that you, or people that you know, have been prescribed the first type of steroid which is known as a corticosteroid. Synthetic corticosteroids are used to treat diseases that involve an allergic reaction such as asthma and dermatitis, and other diseases that are associated with inflammation. Unfortunately, these drugs have many side effects, one of which is loss of muscle mass. Corticosteroids block the production of proteins in the muscle and accelerate their breakdown. Because they accelerate the breakdown of tissue, corticosteroids are described as being \u201ccatabolic\u201d. They also adversely affect bone remodelling by increasing the activity of osteoclasts and reducing osteoblast activity, causing a loss of bone strength. So why do body builders use steroids to increase their muscle mass? The answer is that they are taking a different type of steroid: an anabolic steroid, which is based on the natural hormone testosterone. Hormones that are anabolic stimulate the metabolic pathways and increase protein production. That means they increase both muscle and bone mass, and some athletes use anabolic steroids to enhance the recovery from injury. However, anabolic steroids are associated with a range of adverse side-effects, several of which can be life threatening. As men age, their testosterone production decreases. That\u2019s one of the reasons why ageing men lose muscle mass. The decrease in testosterone also affects bone mineral density and can cause senile osteoporosis.

Accumulated repetitively over time, this leads to stress reactions, and if training is not modified, these become completed stress fractures. Risk factors include an energy deficiency diet and low levels of Vitamin D.

Deep vein thrombosis is a well-known complication of long-distance air travel. In deep vein thrombosis a clot forms within a vein, often in the leg. The symptoms of deep vein thrombosis can include pain and swelling of the affected leg (which is often unusually warm and discoloured, but deep vein thrombosis is often asymptomatic). (The prefix a- means without, or a lack of \u2013 anaemia is a lack of haemoglobin, and asymptomatic means without symptoms. The prefix an- has exactly the same meaning.) The most serious complication of deep vein thrombosis is an embolus, which is a fragment of the clot that breaks free and travels through the circulation until it blocks an artery in the lungs (causing pulmonary thromboembolism) or brain (causing ischaemic stroke). A primary thromboembolism causes chest pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and can be fatal if not treated appropriately. Long-distance air travel increases the likelihood that clotting will occur in normal blood vessels. This is probably due to the effects of hypoxia that leads to activation of platelets and the induction of coagulation. Clotting will also be triggered when blood flow becomes very slow or ceases, which can occur when people are immobile for a long period of time. Contraction of the leg muscles will compress the veins and increase blood flow, as will the use of compression stockings. Dehydration may be another contributing factor because it makes the blood more viscous and therefore decreases blood flow through the veins. Factors that contribute to dehydration include low cabin humidity and possibly the consumption of caffeine and alcohol that increase water excretion from the body.","title":"7.1.

Depolarisation should begin in the sinoatrial node (SA node). The cell membrane potential in the sinoatrial node is unstable and following a depolarisation immediately begins to move towards threshold. Increasing the activity in the sympathetic nervous system makes the membrane potential return to threshold more quickly and therefore increases the heart rate. The electrical activity spreads across the atria triggering contraction of the myocardial cells. When it reaches the atrioventricular node the electrical activity is slowed for a short period of time so the atria are able to contract before the ventricles. The atria really top up the ventricles to ensure they are as full as possible before they contract. After passing through the AV node, the electrical current then continues down the conduction pathway, through the bundle of His, and into the ventricles. The bundle of His divides into right and left pathways (bundle branches) and the Purkinje fibres distribute the electrical activity virtually simultaneously to the entire mass of ventricular muscle. This is important because it means that the ventricles contract in a coordinated fashion enabling them to generate high enough pressure to pump the blood into the arteries.","title":"7.3.

The heart is a pump and like any pump, normal function requires that blood moves through the heart in the right direction, and that the heart can generate pressure to fulfil its pumping function. The heart valves make an important contribution to enabling the heart to meet both requirements. The valves prevent backflow of blood into an area from which it has already moved, and the closure of the atrioventricular valves enables pressure to be generated in the ventricles. Heart murmurs other noise that occurs when blood travels through abnormal valves. The abnormality could be a leak that is caused by valves that do not close properly due to some sort of valvular damage, or it could be the noise that is created when blood is pumped through a narrowed valve. If the valves are leaky they are said to be incompetent, and valve narrowing is known as stenosis. Abnormal valve function has an adverse effect on heart function. The effect will depend on which valve is affected and how severe the damage is. You won't necessarily see evidence of valve damage on an ECG because an ECG is a way of monitoring the electrical function in the heart whereas the valves contribute to the mechanical function of the heart.

Diffusion is a process by which molecules move so our features need to be designed to maximise the amount of movement that occurs. Imagine you are trying to help people get home from a stadium after a major sporting event. One of the things that you could do to help movement would be to open as many gates as possible. In terms of diffusion this is equivalent to increasing the surface area. The alveoli in our lungs create a huge surface area to enable gas exchange to occur. You could also help people leave the stadium by making the distance between the gates and the public transport as short as possible. In terms of diffusion this is minimising the distance over which molecules have to be transported. The distance between the alveoli and the capillaries in our lungs is extremely small. It would also help people to have as many buses available as possible. Our alveoli are extremely well supplied with capillaries meaning that there is plenty of opportunity to transfer oxygen into the blood and to remove carbon dioxide from it. If we are interested in getting people home safely we wouldn't want them to rush the gates or the buses.

At the end of the process of aerobic metabolism electrons must be removed from the electron transport chain. The electrons are reunited with their hydrogen ions and combined with oxygen to form water. If sufficient oxygen is not available a traffic jam will build up back through the system. Initially the traffic jam will be in the electron transport chain and the effect will be to prevent NADH and FADH2 delivering the protons they are carrying to the electron transport chain. Because they can't offload the protons they are not available to collect protons from the Krebs cycle and so the Krebs cycle won't be able to function. The traffic jam will work its way back through the system until there is an increase in the amount of pyruvate in the cell. The pyruvate will be converted to lactate to enable glycolysis to continue.","title":"8.6.

Why is having an adequate blood glucose concentration essential for normal function? How can tissues store glucose so that it can be made available if required? Maintaining adequate blood glucose concentration is essential because glucose is the primary energy source that can be used by the brain. The brain can also use ketones as an energy source but they are not the preferred energy source. We often have glucose to spare and this can be stored in the body in the form of glycogen. The liver is an important site of glycogen storage. When required the glycogen can be broken down to glucose and released into the blood. Glycogen can also be stored in other tissues such as muscle. The easy way to visualise glycogen is as a network of glucose molecules that are joined to each other. As the glycogen is broken down the individual glucose molecules are liberated and can be broken down in metabolic pathways to produce ATP.","title":"9.1.

Why does this occur? Diabetes mellitus is due to a lack of insulin (type I) or due to decreased insulin function (type II). The end result is that glucose is not available for metabolic pathways. As a result the liver rapidly breaks down fat into ketones to use as a fuel source. The 3 most important ketones are acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate. The overproduction of ketones causes them to accumulate in the blood and urine and turn the blood acidic (the ketones are acids). The acetone produced in the liver is the same acetone used as nail polish remover.","title":"9.2.

Hypoplasia '-trophy' refers to specifically the size of the cell (And thus organ) '-plasia' refers to the NUMBER of cells (And also thus the organ) Cell death in more detail Cells normally die in a cyclical manner - there's the saying that every cell in the human body replaces itself within 10 years (though not sure how true this is...). Cell death can be programmed or non-programmed . Programmed cell death is physiological , in that it is a normal process of cell function - the fact that it is programmed means it is desired (i.e. it is homeostatic). Non-programmed cell death occurs as a result of insult or injury to the cell and is not desired - it is also less controlled and can impact cells nearby. The main mechanisms of programmed cell death are: Apoptosis (a.k.a Type 1 cell death) Autophagy (a.ka. Type 2 cell death) Others include Activation-induced cell death, oncosis, mitotic catastrophe, immunogenic cell death, pyroptosis, necroptosis (NOT necrosis) The mechanism of non-programmed cell death is: Necrosis Apoptosis Occurs in eukaryotes as a homeostatic process Cells normally are thought to be kept alive by 'survival factors' (i.e. chemicals in its environment which provide a reason for the cell to be kept alive) - what the exact factors are, we don't need to know.
