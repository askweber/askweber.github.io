The simplest way to describe the cell membrane is as a phospholipid bilayer. Bilayer means 2 layers, and there are 2 layers of phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane. The term phospholipid refers to the structure of the molecule-it is made up of a phosphate head and 2 lipid tails. The phosphate head is negatively charged (so can be described as polar) which makes it hydrophilic (hydro-refers to water and -philic means loving). The phosphate head wants to be in contact with water so it faces the intracellular in the extracellular fluid. The lipid tails are uncharged (nonpolar) which makes them hydrophobic. This means that they don't want to be near water. They are located in the centre of the bilayer. The chemical and physical characteristics of the bilayer makes it a semipermeable membrane. This means that some things can pass through it easily whereas others cannot. The molecules that can pass freely through the cell membrane are lipophilic (which means water soluble molecules are unable to pass directly-the membrane is impermeable to these molecules). Another name for the cell membrane is the plasma membrane.","title":"1.1. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"1.2.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"What is the endoplasmic reticulum? What is the difference in roles of the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and what makes the rough endoplasmic reticulum rough? The endoplasmic reticulum is located inside the cells. The prefix endo- means inside (endocrine hormones are released inside the body, endovascular procedures are performed inside blood vessels). A reticulum is a network.The photograph of an Australian reticulated pipe and below shows the way its markings form a network across its skin. It's that network of markings that gives it the name \"reticulated\". The endoplasmic reticulum is located inside the cells. It is the largest organelle in the cell. An organelle is a structure inside the cell that performs a specific function (s). The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of protein synthesis and transport, lipid and steroid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and calcium storage. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is made up of sealed sacs with ribosomes on their surface. It's the ribosomes that give the organelle its a rough appearance when it is viewed with a microscope. Ribosomes are the organelles that are responsible for the assembly of proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is mainly involved in manufacturing lipids, a process that doesn\u2019t require ribosomes.","title":"1.2.

If you are having trouble visualising this, think about what happens when oil is added to water. Can you suggest a physiological process where this might be important? A phospholipid molecule has a phosphate head that is attracted to water (hydrophilic) and two lipid tails that are hydrophobic. When phospholipids are added to water they arrange themselves into phospholipid bilayers into 'balls' called micelles, into liposomes Micelles are formed in the small intestine as fats in our diet are digested. They move through the watery intestinal contents and come in contact with the cells lining the intestine. They can then be absorbed into the cells by simple diffusion. Liposomes are carriers for targeted drug delivery. They help to obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake of drugs. Steps involved in liposome action of drug delivery: 1. Adsorption: Adsorption of liposomes to cell membranes causes its contact on the cell membrane. 2. Endocytosis: Adsorption of liposomes on the cell surface membrane followed by engulfment and internalization into the liposomes 3. Fusion : fusion of lipid bilayers of liposomes with the lipoidal cell membrane by lateral diffusion and intermingling of lipids results in direct delivery of liposomal contents in the cytoplasm. 4. Lipid exchange : Due to the similarity of liposomal lipid membrane with cell membrane phospholipids, lipid transfer proteins in the cell membrane easily recognize liposomes and cause lipid exchange. For example, in case of cancer cells; they consume large amounts of fats to fill the requirement of rapid growth, they recognize the liposomes (loaded with anti-cancer drug) as a potential source of nutrition. When they are targeted by liposome, they get absorbed. Once the anti-cancer drugs are released from the liposome into the site, cancer cells are killed by the drug.","title":"1.3.

Channel proteins are pores (or tunnels) that enable ions to diffuse through the cell membrane into or out of the cell. Some channels are open all the time, allowing continuous free movement. Others are gated, meaning that movement through them is controlled. This is important in physiological functions such as the action potential used by nerves to transmit information. In nerves, it is the gated sodium and potassium channels that are most important. Each ion has its own channel through which it passes - there are separate Na and K channels in the membrane. Thse ions can't pass directly through the membrane because of its lipid core.","title":"1.4.

In broad terms, what effects do think channelopathies have (i.e. what symptoms would they produce)? Membrane channels play an essential role in cell membrane function, and the cell membrane plays an essential role in cell function. Channelopathies will affect membrane and therefore cell function. The symptoms that are produced will depend on the channels that are affected, their role in the cell, and the function of the cell in the body. Movement of ions through cell membrane channels creates electrical currents and generates the membrane potential essential for the production of action potentials in nerves and contraction of muscles (you will hear more about this later in the semester) and other functions such as signal transduction, neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion, volume regulation, growth and motility. In the muscle they can cause problems ranging from myotonia (muscle hyperexcitability) to flaccid paralysis (muscle hypoexcitability). Channelopathies in the heart cause sudden death due to irregular electrical activity, and are probably contribute to many cases of SIDS.","title":"1.5. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"1.6.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"What is the difference between diffusion and active transport? Diffusion is a process in which ions or molecules move down their concentration gradient (i.e. from an area of higher to an area of lower concentration). The concentration gradient drives the movement, so no energy is required. Because no energy is required, diffusion is described as a passive process. If they have the appropriate chemical structure, molecules can dive views directly through the cell membrane. Because of the chemical nature ions can't directly diffuse through the cell membrane they can diffuse through membrane channels. Larger molecules such as glucose need to be assisted through the cell membrane and this assistance is given by proteins carriers that physically pick molecule up on one side of the membrane and release it on the other. Because this is occurring down the concentration gradient and how energy is required this is still an example of diffusion, but in this case the carrier is helping (or facilitating) the process so it is known as facilitated diffusion. Active transport occurs when carriers pump ions against their concentration gradient (i.e. from their lower to higher concentration). Any pump needs a source of energy to function and the cell membrane carriers are no different. They are using the molecule ATP to power the transport, so this process is known as active transport.","title":"1.6.

The carriers simply provide a pathway or tunnel through the cell membrane along which irons or molecules can pass (but many channels are gated, meaning they can be open or closed). Carriers on the other hand do just what the name suggests-they pick up molecules from one side of the membrane and move them to the other. If the carriers are moving molecules down the concentration gradient and no energy is required they are participating in facilitated diffusion. If they are pumping molecules against their concentration gradient process is active transport.","title":"1.7.

An organelle is a subcellular structure that has one or more specific jobs to perform in the cell, much like an organ does in the body. (National Human Genome Research Institute. USA) Cytoplasmic organelles are \"little organs\" that are suspended in the cytoplasm of the cell. Each type of organelle has a definite structure and a specific role in the function of the cell. (National Cancer Institute) \"Membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) create distinct environments to promote specific cellular tasks such as ATP production, lipid breakdown, or protein export. During recent years, it has become evident that organelles are integrated into cellular networks regulating metabolism, intracellular signaling, cellular maintenance, cell fate decision, and pathogen defence.\" (Schrader et al.

Following assembly, ribosomes are transported to the cell cytoplasm where they serve as the sites for protein synthesis. golgi apparatus - A cell organelle that helps process and package proteins and lipid molecules, especially proteins destined to be exported from the cell. Named after its discoverer, Camillo Golgi, the Golgi body appears as a series of stacked membranes. endoplasmic reticulum - Endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes inside a cell through which proteins and other molecules move. Proteins are assembled at organelles called ribosomes. When proteins are destined to be part of the cell membrane or exported from the cell, the ribosomes assembling them attach to the endoplasmic reticulum, giving it a rough appearance. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and helps synthesize and concentrate various substances needed by the cell. mitochondrion - Mitochondria generate most of the ATP used by cells to drive reactions that require an input of free energy. Each organelle performs the same set of basic functions in all cell types. But to serve the specialized functions of cells, these organelles will vary in abundance and can have additional properties that differ from cell type to cell type.","title":"1.9.

Homeostasis has become the central unifying concept of physiology and is defined as a self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. Homeostasis is not static and unvarying; it is a dynamic process that can change internal conditions as required to survive external challenges. (Billman, G. E. (2020). Homeostasis: the underappreciated and far too often ignored central organizing principle of physiology. _Frontiers in Physiology , 200.)_ _Homeostasis denotes the maintenance, or regulation, of vital internal variables in a state of relative constancy. Automatic cellular mechanisms, neural and endocrine controls, and behavior all contribute importantly to homeostasis. Organisms that function in wider ranges of external environments tend to regulate more internal variables and to have more complex systems regulating important variables \u2013 for example, the adaptable mechanisms with which we mammals regulate body temperature allow us to function in a much wider range of external temperatures than reptiles. Most physiological homeostatic mechanisms rely on negative feedback; that is, signals related to the regulated variable are sensed and cause the system to react in a way that reduces the signals. (_Asarian et al. Homeostasis. Encyclopedia of Human Behavior (Second Edition), 2012). So homeostasis matters because it allows us to continue functioning in a wide variety of environments and to cope with changing demands.","title":"3.1.

One of its functions is to control the movement of molecules between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, and its chemical structure helps it to perform that function. Because of its lipid core, molecules that are polar do not pass easily through the cell membrane. Insulin is an important molecule that affects cell function. The exterior of the molecule is mainly polar, whereas the interior is mainly non-polar. Will insulin be able to pass freely through the cell membrane and if not, how does it influence cell function? Insulin is unable to pass through the cell membrane so it must communicate with the cell from the outside. It does this by combining with receptors on the surface of the cell. These receptors are structures that can specifically interact with the insulin molecule. When the hormone and the receptor combine the end result is a change in cellular function.","title":"3.10. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.11.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"Adrenaline is a protein (polar) hormone that increases blood pressure. Excessively high blood pressure damages the cardiovascular system and other body systems. Elevated blood pressure is an important cause of renal disease and cognitive dysfunction. How could we use our knowledge of adrenaline in the way that it interacts with cells in the treatment of high blood pressure? Adrenaline can only act when it combines with receptors on the cell surface. If we could prevent the adrenaline combine with receptors then we will prevent adrenaline from having its effects. We can do that by using drugs that are called \"antagonists\" or \"blockers\". These block drugs prevent adrenaline from interacting with its receptors. Adrenaline is effects on blood pressure mainly result from its interaction with beta receptors. The drugs that block this interaction are known as beta-blockers.","title":"3.11.

Do you think that cortisol will be able to pass through the cell membrane? Where are the receptors for cortisol likely to be found in the cell? Formulate a general rule for the location of receptors. Because cortisol is a lipid soluble molecule it is able to pass through the cell membrane and enter the intracellular fluid. The receptors for cortisol are located inside the cell. As a general rule we can say that the receptors for watersoluble (peptide) hormones are located on the surface of the cell, and the receptors for lipid soluble hormones are located in the intracellular fluid.","title":"3.12. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.13.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"Below is a flow chart showing how the secretion of cortisol is controlled. This is a classic negative feedback system. Both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland measure the amount of cortisol in the blood. To increase cortisol production in the adrenal gland, the hypothalamus releases the hormone GnRH. GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary to increase the release of the hormone ACTH. ACTH acts on the adrenal gland to increase the production of cortisol. Failure to produce adequate amounts of cortisol causes Addison's disease which is a life-threatening condition. Addison's disease could be the result of problems in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary or adrenal gland. Use the flowchart to explain how you would identify the likely site of dysfunction in a patient with Addison's disease. The aim of the negative feedback system is to maintain appropriate cortisol levels in the blood. If cortisol levels are too low the hypothalamus should release GnRH in the anterior pituitary gland should release ACTH. If a person had hypoadrenocorticism (i.e. Addison's disease) because of a failure in the hypothalamus we would expect to see very low levels of GnRH. If the problem was in the anterior pituitary gland we would expect to see very low levels of ACTH, but GnRH levels would be high (if they could be measured). If a patient had a problem in the adrenal gland and we would expect to see that both GnRH and ACTH levels would be increased.","title":"3.13. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.14.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"Drugs that mimic the effects of cortisol are commonly prescribed to treat inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic conditions. These drugs are commonly called corticosteroids or glucocorticoids and include prednisolone, prednisone, dexamethasone and betamethasone. Although each of these drugs has a different molecular structure they all work in the same general way and mimic the effects of cortisol. What do you think is common between each of these drugs and cortisol that enables them to function in this way? The active part of each of these molecules is able to bind with the cortisol receptors inside the cell. It is only the combination of the receptor and the active part of the molecule that is required to trigger changes in cell function. In other words the synthetic drugs and the natural cortisol all have an area that has a similar chemical structure and can therefore combine with the same receptors.","title":"3.14. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.15.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"The name ACTH is an abbreviation for adrenocorticotrophic hormone. A trophic hormone is a hormone that stimulates growth in another gland-in this case the adrenal cortex which is the site of cortisol production.Corticosteroids for a period of time, it is dangerous to suddenly stop treatment. Why do you think it is dangerous, and what strategy could you use to minimise the risk? Corticosteroids acting in a similar way to cortisol because they can combine with the cortisol receptor. High levels of corticosteroids in the blood are detected in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland and they respond by decreasing the production of GnRH and ACTH. The lack of ACTH results in a decrease in the size of the adrenal cortex and reduced ability to produce cortisol. Therefore stopping glucocorticoid administration suddenly will cause an acute deficiency of cortisol in the blood. The way this problem is avoided is by progressively tapering down the dose of glucocorticoid. In response there is progressive increase in the amount of ACTH in the blood which stimulates growth in the adrenal cortex and restores the ability to produce cortisol.","title":"3.15. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.16.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"Explain the role of oxytocin in childbirth. What sort of feedback system is operating in this example and why? Oxytocin is the hormone that increases the force of contraction of the uterine muscles. Oxytocin is acting as the efferent pathway in this homeostatic mechanism. The controlled variable is the diameter of the cervix. As labour begins the head of the baby is pushed into the cervix and begins to force it open (it becomes wider or dilated). This triggers the release of oxytocin, and the oxytocin increases the force and frequency of the contractions. As a result the baby's head is pushed further into the cervix and the cervix becomes more dilated. The initial change that the homeostatic mechanism is responding to was dilation of the cervix. In other words the controlled variable is being moved away from its set point. The homeostatic mechanism is implementing changes that result in the controlled variable moving even further away from its set point, so this is an example of positive feedback.","title":"3.16. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.17.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"What do we mean when we talk about the osmolarity of the blood and why does it matter? Osmolality indicates the concentration of all the particles dissolved in the body fluid (wherever in the body it is located). Higher osmolality indicates a higher concentration of particles (and as a result a lower concentration of water). Water can move between fluid compartments in the body e.g. between the intracellular and extracellular fluid. Provided the membrane separating the compartments is permeable to water, water moves from the compartment of low osmolality to the compartment of high osmolality. Another way of looking at this is to say that water is moving from the area or its concentration is higher (i.e. osmolality is lower) to the area where its concentration is lower-it is moving down its concentration gradient. When water moves between plasma and intracellular compartments, the movement direction depends on both compartments' osmolalities. For example, if a cell is in a relatively hyperosmolar solution, fluid will move out of the cell and it will shrink.","title":"3.17. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.18.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"Severe head injury can result in swelling of the brain. This is a very serious condition because the brain is entirely contained within the bony skull-it has nowhere to go when it swells so the intracranial pressure increases. Mannitol is a simple sugar that can be administered in intravenous fluids to reduce intracranial pressure. Using your knowledge of osmolarity, try to describe how mannitol exerts its effect. When administered intravenously the mannitol becomes a new solute in the plasma. Because mannitol is a sugar and is therefore water soluble it can't across the cell membrane and remains in the blood. Because the mannitol is a new socket and is therefore increased the number of solutes in the blood, it attracts water from the intracellular fluid into the blood plasma. The water then travels to the kidneys where it gets excreted. The mannitol causes the cells in the brain to dehydrate mildly. In effect, the mannitol is causing the cells of the brain to dehydrate slightly. Cell volume depends in part on the volume of the intracellular fluid, so a decreased intracellular fluid volume decreases cell size. This reduces the overall swelling of the brain.","title":"3.18.

Many diuretics exert their effect by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the kidney tubules. In other words the concentration of sodium ions in the urine is increased. Usual knowledge of osmolality to explain why diuresis occurs. Reabsorption of water in the kidney tubules occurs along osmotic gradients. It is helpful to imagine that the water molecules want to be where the dissolved particles are. If we absorb sodium ions in the kidney tubules then water will follow. If we don't absorb sodium ions and they remain in the year in, then water will also remain and urine volume will increase. Increased urine production (polyuria) is characteristic of diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus the amount of glucose passing through the renal tubules exceeds the capacity of the tubules to resorb it. Hence the glucose acts as an extra particle in the urine and water molecules stay with it. This is known as an osmotic diuresis. Extreme thirst is another symptom of diabetes mellitus. It occurs because the excessive loss of water in the urine has triggered homeostatic mechanisms that aim to return the amount of body water to normal. One way that this can be done is by increasing thirst.","title":"3.19.

The thing that I am trying to control is known as the controlled variable. If I want to control something I need to know what the target level is.

I need to be able to compare the current value of the controlled variable with the setpoint, and decide whether something needs to be done to change the value of the controlled variable. I do that in the controller. I need to have something that will enable me to change the value of the controlled variable. The things that enable you to change the value of the controlled variable are the effectors. I need to get information from the sensors to the controller so that it can be used.

However, excessive water can adversely affect exercise performance and cause problems like headache, altered levels of consciousness, and swelling of the hands legs and feet. Why would these changes occur in what could be done to prevent them? During exercise we sweat. Sweat contains both water and electrolytes. If we replace the fluid with pure water we decrease the concentration of electrolytes in the blood. The most important electrolyte controlling the movement of water between the intracellular and extracellular fluid is sodium. Excessive intake of pure water during exercise results in hyponatraemia. hypo - means low -aemia - means in the blood The best way to protect against the development of exercise induced hyponatraemia is to drink the appropriate amount of fluid.Because fluid losses vary significantly from person to person it's not appropriate to simply recommend a required fluid intake. A more sensible way to approach the problem is to use thirst as a guide to fluid intake-it will prevent both dehydration and overhydration. There is no evidence that sports drinks are protective because they contain low concentrations of sodium. Although excessive water intake is essential contributing factor to exercise induced hyponatraemia, it is not the only important factor. Other contributing factors will be discussed in later questions.","title":"3.20.

Glucose homeostasis is dependent on having adequate amounts of insulin available, and adequate receptors to interact with the insulin. How does the cell know when insulin has combined with its receptor, and how is that information used to change cell function? When insulin binds to receptors on target cells (such as skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes), the signal cascade begins, and finally the glucose transporter GLUT4 is transferred to the cell membrane to allow the uptake of glucose. When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, it triggers the production of signal transduction molecules that are active in multiple intracellular signaling pathways. These molecules can also be described as second messengers (insulin is the first messenger). \"Signaling pathways are complex systems in which a single extracellular signal can elicit multiple intracellular events, some of which may also be triggered by other signaling pathways or may themselves cause other intracellular events. \u201cSecond messengers\u201d is a term used to refer to a diverse group of small molecules or ions that transmit the extracellular signal initiated by a molecule (known specifically as a ligand) binding to a cell surface receptor (Links to an external site.) to effector proteins (Links to an external site.)

Can you unify these ideas to explain how the cell membrane potential is generated? The cell membrane prevents free movement of sodium and potassium ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid. If sodium and potassium ions are going to move through the cell membrane they will move through gated channels. They can only get through the membrane when those channels are open. There is a concentration gradient for sodium and potassium ions favouring the movement of potassium ions out of the cell in the movement of sodium ions into it. A small number of potassium channels are always open allowing potassium leakage out of the cell, and a small number of sodium channels open allowing potassium to enter it. Because there are more potassium ions leaving the cell than sodium ions entering it the interior of the cell develops a negative charge compared to the outside of the cell. This charge difference is maintained by the role of the sodium potassium ATPase pump which is continuously pumping 3 sodium ions back out of the cell and at the same time pumping 2 potassium ions back into it. Eventually the negative charge inside the cell opposes the exit of potassium ions. You can imagine that potassium ions are trying to move out of the cell down there concentration gradient but the negativity inside the cell is keeping them where they are. As result in equilibrium is reached and that is the resting membrane potential.","title":"3.22.

Blood glucose concentration cannot be allowed to fall to low, because the neurones in the brain are relying on glucose to produce the energy they require to function. In previous questions you have looked at the idea that the cell membrane potential depends on the pumping action of the Na-K ATPase carrier in the cell membrane. Nerve function depends on maintenance of the cell membrane potential, so you can imagine that the pump is very active in neurones, and that therefore neurones have high energy requirements. They also have high oxygen requirements because the high levels of metabolic activity, and that is one of the reasons why the brain is the first organ to experience irreversible damage when the circulation fails. A low blood glucose concentration is known as a state of hypoglycaemia. An elevated blood glucose concentration (hyperglycaemia) also creates problems. The higher than normal concentration of glucose molecules in the blood causes an osmotic effect that shifts water in the body. Free water with electrolytes and glucose is lost via urinary excretion producing causing moderate to severe dehydration. Hyperglycemia can be due to reduced insulin secretion, decreased glucose utilization, or increased glucose production. The excretion of excessive amounts of glucose in the urine is known as glycosuria. The abnormally high number of glucose molecules in the urine has an osmotic effect that reduces water reabsorption in the kidneys. Glucose is filtered out of the blood in the filtration area of the kidney (the glomerulus) but is subsequently reabsorbed in the tubule system. People with diabetes mellitus develop like a serious because the reabsorbed if capacity of the tubules is insufficient to cope with the large number of glucose molecules passing through the tubules. As a result urine production is increased (this is known as polyuria). The excessive water loss results in dehydration that triggers thirst, so increased water intake (polydipsia) is a common symptom of diabetes mellitus.","title":"3.23.

How can we enable glucose absorption from the gut, glucose entry into the cells and glucose reabsorption in the kidneys? Ions and molecules that can't pass directly through the cell membrane can pass through using channels or carriers. The channels are like tunnels through the cell membrane through which ions can pass down their concentration gradient. The channels can be open all the time or gated. Gated channels will only allow ions to pass when the channels are open. Carriers can physically move ions and molecules through the cell membrane. If the movement is down the concentration gradient, and the carriers are simply helping the process, this is known as facilitated diffusion. If the movement is against the concentration gradient and the carriers are actively pumping the molecules this is known as active transport. We use carriers to move glucose through cell membranes. One group of carriers is known as the GLUTs ( glu cose t ransporter). They move glucose through the cell membrane the process of facilitated diffusion. In other words glucose is always moving from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration, and no energy is required for this to occur. The other main group of transporters are the SGLTs ( s odium gl ucose t ransporter) which transport sodium and glucose simultaneously. Transporters which carry more than one ion or molecule at the same time are known as symports.","title":"3.24.

We know that the elevated blood glucose levels that occur in diabetes mellitus have an adverse effect on homeostasis. We know that our kidneys are designed to reabsorb glucose in the tubule system. It makes sense to reabsorb glucose because through evolutionary history, providing adequate energy has always been a challenge. It doesn't make any sense to go to the effort of obtaining energy through food, only to have that energy lost through the kidneys. If blood glucose levels are excessively high in a person with diabetes mellitus, it would be sensible to increase glucose loss through the kidneys, and that can be done by inhibiting the SGLTs that are responsible for reabsorption. SGLT inhibitors are useful in the management of hypoglycaemia.","title":"3.25. Canvas solutions"},{"location":"3.26.%20Canvas%20solutions/","text":"How can we store glucose in cells?

Why does diabetic ketoacidosis occur and what effects would it have on the body? The suffix -osis refers to a condition or syndrome, so person with diabetic ketoacidosis has excessive amounts of ketones in their blood, and the high ketone concentration is an effect of the diabetes mellitus. The ketones are acids, so the blood pH is lowered (this is an acidosis or acidaemia). Insulin deficiency and an increase in the counter-regulatory hormones (which work against the action of insulin, raising blood glucose levels in response to hypoglycemia) increases gluconeogenesis and accelerates glycogenolysis. Insulin deficiency and increased counterregulatory hormones also lead to the release of free fatty acids into circulation from adipose tissue (lipolysis) The free fatty acids converted to ketone bodies in the liver. There are many effects of diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients will of course have impaired glucose utilisation because of the deficiency of insulin that triggered the diabetic ketoacidosis. The acidosis changes the pH of the blood and that affects the function of enzymes. The high levels of ketones in the urine have an osmotic effect that causes increased urine production and dehydration. Insulin promotes potassium entry into cells. In diabetic ketoacidosis potassium moves out of cells, thus raising plasma potassium levels. The ongoing potassium movement out of the cell is keeps potassium levels high, but the potassium is excreted through the kidneys, so whole-body potassium depletion develops. This changes the balance of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane, affects the cell membrane potential and therefore the electrical activity in cells. The electrical changes can be very significant in the heart where they can cause fatal electrical abnormalities (arrhythmias).","title":"3.28.

We need to ensure that we have adequate blood pressure to maintain blood flow to the brain. Standing up reduces the pressure in the blood vessels supplying the brain, so the blood pressure is now too low. We need to get the blood pressure back to normal to maintain adequate blood flow. In homeostatic terms what has happened is that the controlled variable (the blood pressure) has fallen below the setpoint and needs to be returned to the setpoint. The best system to do this would be a negative feedback system. The best place to measure blood pressure would be in the vessels that are delivering the blood to the brain, and important sensors are located in these vessels (but because we want an overall picture of blood pressure in the body senses are located in many additional places in the body). If the system failed to work properly you would experience prolonged dizziness, and possibly even faint. That would increase the risk of falling, which is an important problem in older people.

Pyrogens are produced by bacteria that infect the body and by the immune cells that combat the infection. The pyrogens act on the hypothalamus, which is the controller for body temperature, and increase the body temperature set point. Explain the process by which fever develops, and the symptoms that we associate with fever. A: The pyrogens reach the hypothalamus where they change the setpoint (fever is also known as pyrexia). Although the body temperature is that the value that is considered normal, it is below the current set point, and so the negative feedback system begins increasing body temperature to the new set point. Even though your body temperature is apparently normal, you will still feel cold and you will shiver in order to generate heat. Q: When we have a fever, our body temperature has increased it in response to chemicals known as pyrogens. Pyrogens are produced by bacteria that infect the body and by the immune cells that combat the infection. The pyrogens act on the hypothalamus, which is the controller for body temperature, and increase the body temperature set point. Explain the process by which fever develops, and the symptoms that we associate with fever. A: In fever there is an increase in the set point for body temperature. Although the person's body temperature is initially at the level considered normal, it is below the set point, so the negative feedback system operates to increase body temperature to the new set point. When the patient's body temperature is below the set point a person will feel cold, even if their temperature is higher than normal. Shivering helps to increase body temperature because the conversion of energy released during ATP breakdown (the energy that powers muscle contraction) is quite inefficient. Only some of the energy goes to muscle contraction and the rest generates heat. Pyrogens are not the only things that change the set point. There is a diurnal variation - the body temperature of a healthy person increases by about 0.5\u00b0 - 1.0\u00b0C from morning to late afternoon. Body temperature also tends to be higher in women than in men and is approximately 0.4\u00b0C higher during the second half of the menstrual cycle compared with the first. Younger people also tend to have higher body temperatures than older people.","title":"3.5.

Is fever always bad, and should we always treated using drugs? What are the adverse effects of fever and why do they occur? A: Fever is a physiological response to a challenge. It makes sense to think that if our body has developed the response it must have some beneficial effects. Increasing the body temperature does increase our ability to destroy bacteria and viruses, and so routinely suppressing any fever does not make sense. We can suppress fever using drugs that have an antipyretic affect. The pyrogens that increase the setpoint in the hypothalamus do so by inducing the production of prostaglandins. We can block prostaglandin production using commonly available drugs that are known as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). We know that regulation of body temperature is important for the maintenance of normal cell function, so an adverse effect of fever is to impair cell function. This can lead to serious consequences such as seizures, which are most common in infants, but can occur in people of any age. It therefore makes perfect sense to try to lower body temperature in cases of severe fevers. Q: Think about this question-the answer isn't obvious but common sense should help you work it out. Is fever always bad, and should we always treated using drugs? What are the adverse effects of fever and why do they occur? A: Because fever is a response that has evolved in our body makes sense to think that it is of some benefit. Increasing body temperature appears to slow viral replication and to increase the efficiency of the immune system by enabling immune cells to arrive at infection sites more quickly and to improve the activation of many cells contributing to immunity. But fee that also has disadvantages. It significantly increases the metabolic rate meaning that we are breaking down resources more quickly and can cause cell death. Young children are particularly susceptible to the effects of fever and can develop seizures when their body temperature increases. Currently there is debate in the medical world about whether fever should be treated. Studies have shown that deciding not to treat moderate fever does not result in worse outcomes, but is not yet known whether it improves recovery. This is not the only example of important physiological processes potentially causing damage in the body. The immune response is vital but an excessive response causes tissue damage and possibly death. Patients with severe pneumonia may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs to limit ongoing lung damage. The physiological responses to failing heart function help keep us alive in the short term, but in the longer term may hasten death.","title":"3.6.

Another person has been locked in a hot car and also has a body temperature of 40.5\u00b0C. They have hyperthermia. What is the difference between these cases? In the first scenario body temperature has increased because the hypothalamic setpoint increased. The increase in temperature was brought about by the body increasing heat retention and heat generation. Although the body temperature is higher than normal, the increase can be considered appropriate because the body temperature is at the setpoint. In the 2nd scenario body temperature is higher than the setpoint. The negative feedback systems that control body temperature have been unable to restore it to the desired value. Because the body temperature is higher than it should be this is a case of hyperthermia. Although they both result in an increase in body temperature, fever and hyperthermia are 2 entirely different processes. Another good example of the difference comes from the control of ventilation. If we exercise or increase carbon dioxide generation in the body and we increase ventilation in order to increase carbon dioxide removal. Under those circumstances the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood remains at the normal level. However if we are hyperventilating our ventilation is excessively high, and the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood fall below normal.","title":"3.9.

Canvas solutions Glucose is a water soluble molecule and in previous questions you have looked at the fact that water soluble molecules do not passed directly through the cell membrane because of lipid core. How can we enable glucose absorption from the gut, glucose entry into the cells and glucose reabsorption in the kidneys? 3.24. Canvas solutions Use your answer to the previous question to explain how we could we apply our knowledge of glucose transport in the kidneys in the management of diabetes mellitus. 3.25. Canvas solutions How can we store glucose in cells? 3.26. Canvas solutions How does glucose storage in the cells contribute to glucose homeostasis? 3.27. Canvas solutions Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes mellitus. Why does diabetic ketoacidosis occur and what effects would it have on the body? 3.28. Canvas solutions The ketogenic diet is currently popular. How would the ketogenic diet work? Look at the chemical reaction below. This is the carbonic anhydrase reaction that occurs in many cells in the body. It is very useful reaction to remember. $$ \\usepackage{mathtools} H^+ + HCO_3^- H2O + CO2$$ A homeostatic mechanism in our body keeps the carbon dioxide levels in the blood stable by increasing ventilation (i.e. respiratory efforts) when carbon dioxide levels increase. Why is this necessary?

Expanded answer Osmolarity is a measure of concentration of osmotically active particles in solution - depends on number of particles in a volume of solution (Rather than what the type of particle is) Osmolarity differs from molarity as individual ions contribute to the osmolarity For example: - 1Mol of NaCl in 1 L of water has a molarity of 1mol/L - However in water, $NaCl(aq) \\rightarrow Na^{+}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)$ - This means that the osmolality of this solution is 2 Osmol/L (as NaCl dissociates into 2 ions) - 1 mol of glucose in 1L of water has a molarity of 1mol/L - In water, glucose doesn't deionise, meaning its osmolality is still 1 Osmol/L To define tonicity, you need 2 compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane e.g. a cell in solution Questions (from https://journals.physiology.org/doi/epdf/10.1152/advan.00094.2018): Assumptions for the following questions: Our idealized cell has an internal concentration of 300mosM.
